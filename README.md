# School_District_Analysis
##Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to report performance results and patterns from standardized test data. The analysis will help determine decisions on the school’s budget based on the standardized test results. It can help the school board of education more aware of the how school’s budget, size and type can affect test results and where the financial budget is needed. As well as ensuring all data given is clean with no missing or false information and formatted correctly to be clearly understood. 

## Test Results

*The district summary as a whole wasn’t affected much by the changes of Thomas High School. Majority of the numerical values in the categories didn’t even move up one number or drop down. It was relatively the same. This can depict that Thomas High School is more than likely has results that are average and not extremely low or higher than the rest of the schools in the district.  

*School summary is affected as the data depicts all of the top 5 schools are charters while the 5 lowest schools are districts that spend more money per students than the top 5 charters. However, the charter schools do hold less students than the district schools which could affect their results on overall passing percentage and the school’s budget.   

*Thomas Highschool even with the scores changes of the 9th grade class is still one of the top 5 schools overall, so there wasn’t much change comparing it to other schools. It’s a charter school with a medium size schooling. The erasure of the ninth-grade class didn’t affect them much in either a positive or negative way.
